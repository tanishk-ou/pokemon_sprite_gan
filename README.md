# Pokemon Sprites GAN
Training a GAN model to generate pokemon sprites

In Pokémon games, "sprites" are 2D images used to represent Pokémon and other characters in the game. They are the visual representation of these elements on the screen, particularly in older generations of Pokémon games.

I am trying to train a GAN (Generative Adverserial Network) to generate images similar to the official Pokémon sprites used in Pokémon games.

This project is on-going.

GAN is currently in very early stages of training and regular updates and improvements are being made to GAN model architecture according to the generator outputs.

## GAN Architecture
### Initial Model
Conv2d layers for discriminator with ReLU and BatchNorm2d. <br>
ConvTranspose2d layers for generator with ReLU and BatchNorm2d.


Progress will gradually be updated.
