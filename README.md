# Pokemon Sprites GAN
Training a GAN model to generate pokemon sprites

In Pokémon games, "sprites" are 2D images used to represent Pokémon and other characters in the game. They are the visual representation of these elements on the screen, particularly in older generations of Pokémon games.

I am trying to train a GAN (Generative Adverserial Network) to generate images similar to the official Pokémon sprites used in Pokémon games.

This project is on-going.
I have uploaded the augmented dataset of Pokémon sprites for reference.
I have also uploaded a .pth file of the recent checkpoint from GAN training. 

Following is one of the very early generator outputs-

Progress will gradually be updated.
